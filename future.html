As time goes on, it is expected for artificial intelligence to become more advanced, efficient and integrated into our society. Although artificial intelligence has been developing rapidly the past 2 years, it won&apos;t suddenly take over large parts of our lives and replace it with artificial intelligence. Instead, it will gradually start to take over simple tasks which are repetitive, predictable and rule based. The use of artificial intelligence by businesses, especially generative artificial intelligence, has already increased, mainly for repetitive tasks such as web interaction, retail and data entry. The topic of jobs being taken over by artificial intelligence is one of the biggest and most popular ones when it comes to artificial intelligence. Because artificial intelligence is so good in tasks which are repetitive and predictable. The outcome of it is that repetitive jobs such as customer service are continuously being replaced by chatbots, which has led to fears over job losses. Although artificial intelligence has made companies gain profit, it has also led to an unequal demand for jobs. For example, customer service jobs are being taken care of by generative artificial intelligence and chatbots, but the demand for other jobs such as information security analysts has risen significantly. Although a lot of jobs might be partially or fully taken over by artificial intelligence, there are jobs which are extremely hard to fully replace by artificial intelligence. Creative jobs such as authors, musicians and designers are difficult for artificial intelligence to replace because they rely heavily on human feelings, social interactions, human preferences and emotional depth which are concepts artificial intelligence cannot fully comprehend nor replicate. Not only has artificial intelligence started to affect jobs, but it has also started to affect the mental well-being of society. It&apos;s very easy for students to use chatbots such as ChatGPT to do their homework, whereas adults might ask Gemini what to make for dinner. As society starts to become more and more dependent on artificial intelligence, it might lead to a lack of creativity, lack of motivation and induced stress when having to solve problems without the use of artificial intelligence. Over time, people will start to struggle with thinking critically, having face-to-face interactions and making decisions on their own. Another concern about artificial intelligence is its impact on the climate. The amount of energy and resources which are required to power, create, and maintain artificial intelligence centres are predicted to increase the carbon emissions by 80%. Not only that but artificial intelligence power centres use enormous amounts of water to cool down the generators. Artificial intelligence doesn&apos;t only have negative sides though; it has huge amounts of potential when it comes to healthcare. It can help us detect diseases earlier, it can assist doctors with finding a cure for diseases and illnesses which we’ve been struggling with for a while, and it can help with the administrative tasks such as data entry and test analysis. Not only that but artificial intelligence has already made a huge impact on the global economy. Statistics tell us that artificial intelligence could contribute up to 15.7 trillion dollars to the global economy by 2030. However, economic growth alone does not ensure artificial intelligence will have a positive impact on society. To ensure artificial intelligence will have a positive impact on our society as a whole, we need to make sure governments, companies and individuals must take responsibility for how artificial intelligence is used and developed. This means setting ethical boundaries and guidelines, protecting privacy and making sure that artificial intelligence doesn&apos;t fully replace humans and their jobs. Instead, artificial intelligence should be used to take over time consuming and repetitive tasks. That way society can focus on the creative, social and interactive jobs. If we can focus on making artificial intelligence more sustainable, we can use it to create environmentally friendly energy, reduce waste and improve energy sufficiency. By focusing on making artificial intelligence more sustainable, safer and more cooperative between humans, we can use it as a tool to help improve our society instead of harming it. So, in the end, whether artificial intelligence will have a positive or negative impact on our society really comes down to whether we put in enough effort to develop it properly, safely and make sure people don&apos;t misuse it. In the end, artificial intelligence should merely be a tool to help humanity with daily tasks, and not something that we heavily rely on to get through our day. This would require long-term planning, education on artificial intelligence and research on how to prevent it into becoming something dangerous. Only if we stay aware of how artificial intelligence develops can we ensure its development into a safe and useful tool for the next generations.            </p>          </div>          <br><br>                </div>      </div>    </div>	  <footer style="color: white;">  <p>Gemaakt door Irene en Oliwia</p>  <a href="#begin" style="color: white;">Naar begin pagina</a></footer>    <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>  </body></html>
