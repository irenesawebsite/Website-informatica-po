Ai can be a very versatile and useful tool, as so it gets used for many different things and is used by a spectrum of different people in all different types of fields and professions and age groups. 	  <br><br>As most probably already know, ai is often used by students, predominantly in middle and high school. Most teachers have already seen a widespread use of ai by students who use it to make their assignments. This creates a huge inequity for the integrity of and trust in academic works, as it has become increasingly difficult to recognise ai and limit the use of it. Besides the negative responses to ai, some teachers have learnt to work with ai. To for example make test questions and prepare for lessons. Some teachers even use it to convert texts into easier language for students in lower years to use. Most autorotative figures in education do still agree that if ai is to be used there will have to be clear boarders and rules set in place for it and for those rules to often be updated because of the fast development of ai.	  <br><br> Ai is generally seen as dishonest and unfair in educative spaces; however, it is often viewed in a different light at the workplace by both employees and employers. In surveys it's been shown that around 75 precent of business executives use ai in their business but around half of them have also said that they are worried about data breaches and inaccuracies with the use of generative ai. Besides some reserve a lot of people have embraced ai in their work to for example make tests, develop code, write e-mails and generally cut down on time spent doing repetitive tasks. Widespread response to this is that employers are actively looking for candidates with experience in using ai. Besides hiring experienced ai users, employers are also pushing for their employees to learn how to use ai effectively to same time, decrease the workload and save money. People have also started using ai to compose their resumes and cover letters for job applications, often seeing a positive response to the AI generated resume. In turn businesses have been using ai in recruitment, using it to filter out unfit candidates and look for feasible matches for the position they are trying to fill by looking though their job applications. Some even use ai to inspect applicants' speech patterns and facial expressions to try and determine the personality and attitude of said person to try and detect the fit of an applicant.<br><br> Many people also use ai in their daily lives. Chatbots for example are often used to entertain people, answer questions, make decisions, give ideas and give advice. Some people think this is a useful and easy way to solve problems and some people think it's unnecessary and that people should just use their brain or google for these simple things. But ai is also in used in your daily life without you actively initiating it. Like though advertisement. Alot of brands use ai to recommend and advertise products that you may like based on personal information of what you've looked at and engaged with online. Or in auto correct. Many apps use a language learning ai to suggest following words to your message. Or in many facial recognition technologies like that in the I-phone. </p></font></font><br><br><br><img src="harry.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="#begin">Naar begin pagina </a>    </div> <!-- /container -->    <!-- Le javascript    ================================================== -->    <!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster -->    <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>  </body></html>
