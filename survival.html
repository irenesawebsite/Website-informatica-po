Infact it is one of the most talked about topics regarding artificial intelligence. Whether artificial intelligence can feel emotions, go into fight or flight mode, or maybe even take over the world will remain one of the most highly debatable topics, both by scientists and the general public. With the rapid rate at which artificial intelligence is developing, the chances of it actually developing its own conscience keeps growing as well. Nowadays the idea of artificial intelligence developing its own conscience doesn&apos;t seem that unlikely or purely fiction as it did before. But before we can answer the question of whether artificial intelligence can develop its own conscience, we need to dive deeper into what it actually means to be conscious. Defining the word conscience is particularly challenging, because we haven&apos;t established a clear nor universally accepted definition of the word. Neurologists and scientists have been studying brain activity and have been tracing specific parts of the brain which &ldquo;light up&rdquo; when we perceive or feel something. Yet none of them fully capture the essence needed of the so-called conscience in order to understand what being conscious means. To know whether artificial intelligence has a conscience we need to know the distinction between intelligence and consciousness. Intelligence is measured by learning, adapting, predicting and problem solving. Consciousness on the other hand involves personal experience. Take a game of chess for example. An intelligent system will simply play the game, whereas a conscious system feels the excitement of the game, frustration of losing and the satisfaction of winning. Philosophy is one of the main roles when it comes to the debate about whether artificial intelligence has a conscience or not. Philosophers have questioned this subject for a very long time now, what does it truly mean to &ldquo;know&rdquo;, &ldquo;feel&rdquo; or &ldquo;think&rdquo; and of course these questions also extend to machinery. Thought experiments such as the &ldquo;Chinese room&rdquo; by John Searle, suggested that although the artificial intelligence behaved as if it understood the language and emotions, it most likely still lacks genuine awareness and emotions. The fact we do not know the proper definition of a conscience, means we also cannot tell whenever and if a machine develops one. The reason why artificial intelligence is part of this debate is because it mimics the human mind, human thinking and expression of feelings. This is to make it as approachable as possible and give proper answers to questions, prompts or conversations. This imitation becomes concerning especially when the artificial intelligence is put under pressure, as was shown in the testing of the new Claude Opus 4, launched by the firm Anthropic. During the testing the firm made the Claude Opus 4 act as an assistant at a fictional company and was provided with emails implying it would soon be taken offline and replaced. Aswell as a separate email containing the information, that the engineer who was going to take it offline was having an extramarital affair. It then proceeded to blackmail the engineer by threatening to reveal the affair he was having. Surprisingly it only proceeded to do so after it was given the option to either blackmail the engineer to try and keep its job, or accepting its replacement. The results raised another question: if artificial intelligence can mimic human reactions, emotions and survival instincts to such an extent, will this blur the line between intelligence and consciousness? Some researchers say that human interpret goal-oriented behaviour as intentional, even when its fully mechanical and coded. Although the artificial intelligence mimicked a regular human reaction perfectly, it showed that the artificial intelligence did not experience genuine fear, panic or the will to survive. This shows that artificial intelligence can mimic survival-like instincts even without having any feelings. It chose the option which best fit within its programmed responses and intelligence. Despite this, it still raised concern amongst researchers due to the fact artificial intelligence has developed enough in order for it to choose unethical actions when put under pressure. In conclusion, current artificial intelligence does not have a conscious of its own nor a survival instinct. Some scientists say there may be a chance through hybrid systems that combine biological and digital elements, whereas some say artificial intelligence will never develop its own conscience no matter how advanced they get. It&apos;s hard to give a definitive answer as to whether AI will get its own conscience or not. We may never be able to settle the question with just science, as the idea also touches philosophy, psychology and ethics. Who knows, maybe machines will develop a conscience of their own, but until we&rsquo;re able to find out a way to get a definitive answer we won&apos;t know for sure if artificial intelligence has its own conscience or not. Perhaps we should focus more into the study of what conscience is before trying to figure out if something without its own feelings, thought and emotions has one.            </p>          </div>          <br><br>                 </div>      </div>    </div>	  <footer style="color: white;">  <p>Gemaakt door Irene en Oliwia</p>  <a href="#begin" style="color: white;">Naar begin pagina</a></footer>    <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>  </body></html>
