One of and most likely the most well-known way of ai being incriminating is deep fakes (the word is derived from deep learning and fakes). Where a person can create new images through photo shopping, overlaying and combining existing images. But with ai it is extremely easy and possible to make completely new images/videos. The problem with that is that those deep fakes are extremely difficult or even not possible to distinguish from real images. People use these generated deep fakes for many reasons among which scaring people, tainting someone's reputation, blackmail or fraud. With ai deep fake technology it is possible to create videos of famous people promoting fake shares or products, with intent to mislead people into trusting these sellers. Or fake porn images can be made by placing a person's face over a pornographic video/image to make it seem like that person is actually the one in those images, which is done to taint someone's reputation or to blackmail a person by threatening to release the images unless they pay/do something the perpetrator requests. Another criminal use of deep fakes is using it to make child pornography. Which is extremely dangerous as it normalizes and strengthens the association of children being involved in explicit situations even if real children weren't used in the making itself.              <br><br>A different way of ai being used in an incriminating way, are deep fakes made of someone's voice, where audios can be made using your voice to make it seem like you said something you didn't. Which is done for the same reasons as why deep fakes are used.              <br><br>Deep fakes have also made its mark in the court of law. The trust in the validity of evidence has been tainted as the accusing or defending party can now create fake images or voice messages proving a person innocent/guilty. As of now, juries are responsible for determining if evidence is valid or not. Which was usually determined by extensive evidence or for example a relative determining if the voice in a voice message is actually the person who they say it is. But this has gotten more unreliable by the extremely realistic deep fakes and the technology for detecting ai being less advanced than the ai itself.              <br><br>Ai can also be dangerous through its use to mass send scam emails and create code for said scam emails with bugged links built in. Making it increasingly accessible for criminals with limited coding capabilities to make websites with bugs, scam emails and steal information.              <br><br>In a different direction, ai can be an unreliable detection agent. A lot of police stations use algorithmic ai to try and predict areas of where a lot of crime may be committed or people who may commit a crime. Though, a critical flaw in this area has been observed where the ai mimics a flaw often seen in human officers. Making bias decisions and predictions, this is a direct result of the ai being fed bias information where it then targets for example certain racial groups.              <br><br>Ai is also used to spread disinformation by political people. Take Venezuela, where political media platforms have shared clips of a fake English-speaking news channel spreading pro government statements. Or in America, deep fakes were made of former president Biden making offensive comments and of Donald Trump hugging and kissing Anthony Fauci. Images and posts have also been made with ai to spread pro government propaganda. This type of slander and misinformation has been on the rise over the last few years due to generative ai being more and more accessible and cheap. On account of all these ai generated features, people have become increasingly sceptical of the validity of information. While critical thinking is vital in this age of technology, political leaders also use this distrust to make people doubt in real, valid information.            </p>          </div>          <br><br>          <img src="trump.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="">          <br><br><br>          <a href="#begin">Naar begin pagina</a>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>  </body></html>
