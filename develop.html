Approximately three thousand years ago we encounter interest in artificial intelligence to preform servile duties for its human owner. In Greek mythology Hephaestus, the Greek god of smithing, uses automatic bellows and intelligent golden maiden-formed machines blessed with perception, hearing and speech to assist him with his duties. Later, in 400BCE, stories circulate of an intelligent moving sentry patrolling the shores of Crete bestowed upon the island&apos;s people by Hephaestus himself. Early humans already held a fascination and a need for more powerful beings, it seems, be it gods or machines. <br><br> The ancient Greek culture is called &ldquo;Hellenic culture&rdquo;. Seeing the prevalence of artificial machinery in early Hellenic writing, it&apos;s no surprise that late Hellenistic engineers turned to designing and building these machines. The first real documented success story is Heron of Alexandria who created all kinds of machines between 20-100AD his most predominant invention being that of a humanoid automaton, this is the first instance of a &ldquo;robot&rdquo; we know of and therefore the first instance of one of the core-components that led to AI. <br><br> Leaping ahead and diving into a spitfire list of developments;<br> in 1654 Blaise Pascal described how to find expected values in probabilities which was expanded upon by several people all throughout the 17th and 18th century, this instance was the birth of probability theory which is a core ingredient in machine learning. <br> Later in 1672 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz would create the Stepped Reckoner, a calculator that could do multiplication, this was a major development in computing. <br>In 1739 inductive reasoning is described by David Hume, a form of logic that would grow important in AI. <br>In 1805, during the height of the industrial revolution, Joseph Marie Jacquard would invent the first programmable machine, a loom with replaceable punch cards that controlled sequences of operations for the loom. <br> Moving swiftly along to the century 20th century20th century in 1910 Bertrand Russell showed that all of elementary mathematics could be reduced to mechanical reasoning. Just two years later in 1912 the first real AI pioneer is made, El Ajedrecista, a robot that could calculate and win chess endgames. The next major development in AI was Alan Turing&apos;s report on intelligent machinery in 1948 laying out many bases for modern AI such as logic-based strategies for problem-solving, the theory that intellectual activity consists mainly of different kinds of search, his paper products the very thing we use for AI today, the Connectionism AI approach. A year later Donald O. Hebb develops the Hebbian theory, an algorithm to use for learning in neural networks. A neural network is a computation system inspired by the human brain using interconnected nodes similar to our neurons layered upon each other to find patterns. It makes connections and assigns them a weight which allows it to find intricate relationships. In 1951 the first working true AI programs are written by the University of Manchester, one to play chess, the other to play checkers. In 1963 we see the first instance of machine learning Leonard Uhr wrote a program that can recognize patterns and self-evaluate the strenght of it&apos;s connections. Machine learning means a machine that can teach itself, basically the way it works is you have an evaluator AI which knows an &lsquo;ideal&rsquo; outcome. There is also a student bot that takes a test. The first generation of students, for example, takes a test where it is shown 100 pictures and has to identify which ones are fruit, each student bot has a base code but is slightly mutated from the template. The bots all fill out their test and the teacher bot selects N bots who did best, for example the top 10. The code of these top 10 students becomes the foundation for the next generation of 100 bots each again with slight mutations, in this way the bots keep evolving and evolving until the human programmer himself cannot comprehend fully what the bot is doing to fetch its result. This is the basis of AI training. After this, the technology cascaded and cascaded, grew and grew, and what started as basic AI models predicting chess games and basic language snowballed through development and development into the large language models we know today. Reflecting on AI it&apos;s easy to think it just &lsquo;appeared&rsquo; AI was never a major topic and then around the 2020s suddenly it was everywhere, maybe some of the people reading this remember an early website where you could talk to an ai in a very limited and primitive sense, but nothing like the LLMs we see today. It is important to remember And</p>            <p>                         </p>          </div>          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                  </div>      </div>    </div>	  <footer style="color: white;">  <p>Gemaakt door Irene en Oliwia</p>  <a href="#begin" style="color: white;">Naar begin pagina</a></footer>    <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>  </body></html>
