Just look at the countless books, movies, shows, art pieces, and other media about this topic, its benefits and its negative aspects. <br><br> One of the earlier mentions of artificial intelligence was an idea similar to algorithmic text generation in Jonathan Swift&rsquo;s popular novel &quot;Guilliver&rsquo;s Travels&quot;. In which a machine made to generate ideas by turning these big wooden handles to make wooden blocks with words on them rotate, was mentioned. This machine was created to assist scholars and professors with making up ideas for research papers , literairy texts, and debate topics. If machines (will ever) have sentience is more of a philosophical matter, but machines with intelligence are no longer a thing of the future. It hasn&rsquo;t been a thing of the future since nineteen twelve, when the engineer and scientist Torres Quevedo built El Adjedrecista. El Adjedrecista is a chess playing machine which could play chess games consisting of two kings and a rook. Where El Adjedrecista would play the white king and white rook against the black king, with the artificial intelligence&rsquo;s king placed on A eight and the rook on B seven. El Adjedrecista could counter any defense with fifty moves or less. <br><br> Torres Quevedo arranged a variety of components like variable resistors, lead-acid accumulators, electromagnets and mercury tilt switches that controlled the machine&lsquo;s behavior in a big wooden box with two metal arms acting to move El Adjedrecista&rsquo;s pieces. When the human playing against El Adjedrecista would set their next move, electrical contacts under the black and white squares of the metal chessboard connected to the machine would pick up on a small change in the voltage over the metal chessboard. Every shift in polarity on the board would trigger the long series of relay circuits and through additional electrical connections El Ajedrecita&rsquo;s arms would be enabled, and the machine would pick up its own pieces and move them to counter its opponents&rsquo; move. In its most basic components, El Ajedrecista worked by breaking down all the chess positions into long strips of binary inputs to show if a piece is present or not present and react to that. <br><br> Besides El Adjedrecista undeniable use as entertainment, Torres Quevedo didn&apos;t create El Ajedrecista as a simple fun novelty. The chess machine proved that a machine could make analytical choices highly comparable to decisions made by a real human mind even if only thorough mechanization. El Adjedrecista was verry popular and was documented on video and photo at its first open public event. Torres Quevedo wrote many papers on El Ajedrecista, how he made the groundbreaking chess playing machine and how its mechanical &quot;mind&quot; resonated with human ways of learning and observation. El Ajedrecista is in a lot of ways the big brother of modern ai and the machine was a huge inspiration to engineers and scientists who would come after him, like Allan Turring. El Ajedrecista&rsquo;s systematic way of countering opponents&rsquo; moves prefigured the algorithmic    mechanisms used at the base of a lot of current day ai machines. Another way El Ajedrecista planted its roots in modern Artificial Intelligence, is in the ai models who absorb knowledge and show rezoning capabilities that are eerally simeler to human decision making and resoning but it really stems from the binary ways of reworking input into actions that Torres Quevedo first thought of in nineteen twelve while creating the infamous chess playing machine, El Ajedrecista. <br><br></p>            <br>            <img src="PrimerAjedrecista.jpg" width="250" style="margin-right: 20px;">            <img src="el adjesista foto 2.png" width="300">			<video width="320" height="240" controls>  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>          </div>          <br><br>                  </div>      </div>    </div>	  <footer style="color: white;">  <p>Gemaakt door Irene en Oliwia</p>  <a href="#begin" style="color: white;">Naar begin pagina</a></footer>    <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>  </body></html>
